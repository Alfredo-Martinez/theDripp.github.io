# Personal-Website
This is a website about me. I'm mainly writing it to teach myself front-end web developement and later back-end as well. Everybody is welcome to add things or comment on better practices.
 
So far, I've decided to start with the Bootstrap framework and FontAwesome iconography.

Pattern taken from http://www.colourlovers.com/pattern/2290455/d_u_s_k
Credit to earlgrey for the finished pattern & colorballa for the pattern template.
