# Personal-Website
 This is a website about me. I'm mainly writting it to teach myself front-end web developement and later back-end as well. Everybody is welcome to add things or comment on better practices.
 
So far, I've decided to start with Bootstrap and FontAwesome. I might struggle a bit to make Bootstrap work on all platforms but we'll see.
